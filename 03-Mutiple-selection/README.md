# Multiple Selection
Store component level state on root component, and render child component based on it. All event handlers are designed to change state, and all component will re-render based on change.

## Getting Started

### Running the project

* Open the .html file in browser.


## Built With

* Plain JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

## To Improve

* Only update corresponding component based on state change, instead of re-writing the entire App on every state change.

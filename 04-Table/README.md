# Table
Store component level state on root component, and render child component based on data. Event handlers are designed to change state, and components will be updated only if necessary.

## Getting Started

### Running the project

* Open the .html file in browser.


## Built With

* Plain JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

## To Improve

* Currently every piece of information needed for lower level component to render and update is store in state, including event handler. Need to solve this in a better way.
